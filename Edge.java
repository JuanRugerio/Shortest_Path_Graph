/**
 Commentary: Declares package.
 Declares public class called Edge
 Declares that this class uses two integer variables called v and w that are private to the class and another double
 called weight that is private too.
 Then declares a public constructor where the local names are the same as what the class counts with. Then, it
 instantiates the variables with the values it receives.
 A "something that I donÂ´t understand pretty well" that prints the legend and the values
